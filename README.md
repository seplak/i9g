# i9g (infuriating)

What is this?

[Numeronyms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeronym) are a horrible idea, but since we keep using them, make your own.

## Installation

```
go install github.com/seplak/i9g
```

## Usage

Want to turn a word into a numeronym? You can put your text in quotes. Or not. It's all going to be a pile of garbage anyway.

```
➜ i9g internationalization
i18n
```

Or a whole sentence??

```
➜ i9g "I do observability with Kubernetes"
I do o11y w2h K8s
```
